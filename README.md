# SAPLink-Plugins
This repository contains plugins for SAPLink which I authored. 
*It is mandatory to have installed SAPLink prior to cloning this repository*

# ABAPGit-Bridge
ABAPGit allows easy syncing of Git-Repositories with ABAP packages. 
However, the support for oject types is not yet as wide as the obje by SAPLink.
Thus, I implemented an adapter which wraps SAPLink-Plugins in order to use them with ABAPGit
